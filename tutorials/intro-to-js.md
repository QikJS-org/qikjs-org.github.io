# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. It can run in your browser or on a server with Node.js.

## Key Points
- JS is interpreted, not compiled.
- Can manipulate HTML and CSS.
- Supports variables, functions, objects, arrays, and more.

```js
console.log("Hello, QikJS!");
```
